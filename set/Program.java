		 * Set<T> Set<T> Represents a set of elements (similar to algebra) 
		 * - Does not allow repetitions; 
		 * - Elements do not have a position; 
		 * - Access, insertion and removal of elements are fast; 
		 * - Provides efficient set operations: intersection, union, difference; 
		 * - Main implementations: 
		 * 		a) HashSet: Faster (O(1) operations in hash table) and unordered; 
		 * 		b) TreeSet: Slower (O(log(n)) operations in red-black tree) and ordered 
		 * 			by the object's compareTo (or Comparator) 
		 * c) LinkedHashSet: Intermediate speed and elements in the order they are added.
